        <h2>About O'neals</h2><br />
	
        
            <p>O'neals has brought the gulf coast local flavor for 26 years now and some wonder how they always seem to amaze.</p>
            <a href="about.html"><img src="images/danny.jpg" alt="owner" width="300" height="250"></a>
            <br />
            <p>He has always kept his business local and didn't like the idea of franchising and
            taking a chance at the quality possibly not being at the same high standard until these past two years.
            He took a chance on the wild side and decided to manage two restaurants by opening one in McHenry, MS.
            Ever since, O'neals has been rolling and talks of more restaurants are on the horizon. <br />
            You can find Danny O'Neal perfecting your Po'Boys in the Gulfport or Mchenry location 7 days a week.
            
            The restaurant was established in 1988 and has had years of success in bringing local flavor
            and hospitality to the Mississippi gulf coast.</p>
